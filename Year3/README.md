## Computer Networking 2 - CMP314
The ideas and concepts of how computers, mobile devices and gadgets communicate via a wide range of communications technologies with each other, and other devices. This includes interactions via technologies such as Ethernet, VLANS, STP, Wireless, Routing, Subnetting, IPv6, SNMP, DHCP, DNS, Firewalls and Network Management
Indicative content:

    VLANS: Describe the core concept of VLANS and trunking along with the common attacks that can be used against them.
    STP: Investigate how STP can be used to create a loop free network and how this can be exploited by an attacker.
    Static Routing: Examine how routing works and show it can be used for pivoting deeper into a network.
    Subnetting and Variable Length Subnet Masks: Classful and classless addressing. Benefits and impact on routing protocols. Design of LANs using VLSM techniques.
    Network Application protocols: Investigation into various networking protocols used at the application layer of the OSI model along with common security weaknesses.
    Firewalls: Software and hardware firewalls - their application, uses and how to counter them.
    Intrusion Detection Systems: Examine how Intrusion detection systems work and how they can be bypassed.
    Network management: Examine network management protocols (Simple Network Management Protocol SNMP) and current practice.

### Grade: A

Indicative content:

    Background to Smart and Mobile Development: Challenges in developing for smart including mobile devices. Development strategies, emulators and development environments. Use of the application abstraction to allow easier development.
    User Interfaces: Development of interfaces for user-interaction including UI controls (buttons, forms) and underlying hardware controls (key presses, touch screen). Basic control of a mobile device using the high user interface. Use of commands and forms to gain data from the client. Use of low level features to display data to the user. Use of key presses to control real-time application.
    Storage: Consideration of storage requirements for mobile devices. Saving and retrieving local and remote storage. Overview of database design. Use of remote databases, and how to use server side databases in an internet application. Use of internet based scripting to generate server-side text for the client.
    Location awareness: Utilising the network location capabilities of mobile devices to develop feature rich applications.
    Telephony SMS: Understanding the telephony and SMS stack on the mobile device and the use of APIs required for their access and control.
    Communication Networks: Using short and long-distance networks for communication and understanding of the limitations and benefits of each.
    Security: Consider the security implications of mobile and smart platforms, how these can be exploited and development considerations to improve resilience.
    Performance: Methods for testing the functionality and performance of applications on mobile devices.
    Mobile Web Application Development: Explore and evaluate a range of mobile solution options from response design, Firebase-, and JavaScript-based applications.

### Grade: A
