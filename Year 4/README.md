    Recording, Reporting and Communication Skills.
    Employability and professional development.
    
### Grade: B+

## Honours Project Dissertation - CMP403

Present as a dissertation a major, in-depth individual project in an aspect of your programme. Normally you will devise the project, drawing from current industry and/or research based problem areas. Present your work in a structured and coherent manner which allows for critical and insightful review and evaluation of the project and artefact produced. Write the dissertation in academic style appropriate to your domain of study.
Indicative content:

    Introduction: Introduce the topic of the project and the problem area with and appropriate research question.
    Investigate: Investigate previous work in the chosen project area and show how the work of the project relates to it.
    Justify: Demonstrate a sound justification for the approach and methodology adopted.
    Document: Document the output of the project with some originality.
    Evaluate: Critically evaluate the output, using third party evaluation where appropriate, and recognise the strengths and limitations of the work.
    Communicate: Communicate your work professionally in the required academic format/style. Demonstrate an ability for independent learning and linkage to future work and career aspirations.

### Grade: B

## Engineering Resilient Systems 1 - CMP417

Social and technical approaches to better security resilience in systems through consideration of methods of attack and defence.
Indicative content:

    Principles of Secure Software Development: The relationship between correctness, security and performance. Defence in depth. Input, output and state validation. Minimal privilege and privilege separation.
    Language and API Design for Security: Inherent security problems with widely-used languages, and why people still use them. Undefined behaviour and compiler optimisations. Enforcing security properties using better type systems and language semantics. DSLs for security.
    Secure Software Engineering: Security within the SDLC. Specifying security requirements. Secure coding standards. Code review for security.
    The Ingredients of Machine Learning: Overview of the different ‘aspects’ of machine learning. All machine algorithms are not created equal. Applications of machine learning for cyber-security. Review of the various types of algorithms and the mathematics behind the algorithms. Exploration of supervised and un-supervised classifications.
